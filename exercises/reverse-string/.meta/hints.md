## Bonus
Test your function on this string: `uuÌˆu` and see what happens. Try to write a function that properly
reverses this string. Hint: grapheme clusters

To get the bonus test to run, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the
last test, and execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test --features grapheme
```
